# Telegram and VK bots
Bots for fast and mobile issuance of certificates. This approach best used on Open Days or on lections.

Works only on Windows (there is already a version of Certificater for Linux, this project will be adapted soon as well).

Before running either bot  you need to setup a template .pptx file. Also make sure to create a virtual envirnment and install all dependencies and requiremnts there.

Creates virtual environment

    python -m venv "name of your virtual environment"

Downloads all project requirements and dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

User simply needs to write their name to bot and they'll recieve cetificate about participating
